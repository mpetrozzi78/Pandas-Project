Heores of Pymoly Analysis
HEROES OF PYMOLI Observations

Gender Analysis

1)	84.03% of the players are male while 14.06% are females. Despite the considerably higher number of male players, males do not spend more than females. In fact, females spend on average $4.47 while males spend $4.07, which might be explained by a male preference for cheaper items. The male average purchase price ($3.02) is indeed lower than the female one ($3.20). 

Age Analysis

2)	Majority of players are people aged 20-24 representing 44.79% of the total number of players. As a result, the total purchase value of this age group ($1,114.06) represents almost 47% of the total revenues of the game ($2,379.77). However, people in this group are not the ones who spend the most on Heroes of Pymoli. People aged 35-39 seem to spend on average ($4.76) more than the others due to a preference for more expensive items: average purchase price is $3.60 versus $3.05 of the 20-24 age group.

The Top Analysis

3)	Even though we have observed that females spend more than males on the game, the 5 top spenders are predominantly males with a female exception in 3rd place (Chamjask73). This result shows that top spendersâ€™ analysis might not be very useful to show gender expenditures tendencies.
